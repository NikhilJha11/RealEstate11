## Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Datasets from multiple sources have been concatenated and fetched.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to ensure its quality and readiness for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The cleaned dataset is analyzed using EDA techniques to uncover insights and trends.
4. Data Visualization: Visual representations of the data help in understanding patterns and relationships.
5. Feature Engineering & Clustering: New features are created, and clustering techniques are applied to group similar data points.
6. Model Training & Evaluation: The dataset is split for training and evaluation, followed by the application of various machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset includes a growth price section, providing valuable insights into price trends over time.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling and clustering)
